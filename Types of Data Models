üìä Types of Data Models  

Data models organize and structure data for effective use in systems. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

### 1. Conceptual Data Model  
   - Purpose: High-level view of business requirements.  
   - Focus: Entities, relationships, and business rules (no technical details).  
   - Example: "Customers place Orders" ‚Üí defines what the system needs.  
   - Used By: Stakeholders, business analysts.  

### 2. Logical Data Model  
   - Purpose: Translate concepts into structured rules.  
   - Focus: Attributes, data types, keys (e.g., primary/foreign keys), normalization.  
   - Example: `Customer (ID, Name, Email)`, `Order (OrderID, CustomerID, Date)`.  
   - Used By: Database architects, developers.  

### 3. Physical Data Model  
   - Purpose: Actual database implementation.  
   - Focus: Storage, indexing, partitioning, DB-specific details (e.g., tables, columns).  
   - Example: SQL table scripts with indexes, data types like `VARCHAR(255)`.  
   - Used By: DB admins, engineers.  

### üåê Database-Specific Models  
- Relational Model: Tables with rows/columns (SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- Hierarchical Model: Tree-like structure (e.g., XML, legacy systems like IBM‚Äôs IMS).  
- Network Model: Graph-like connections (flexible but complex; used in older CODASYL systems).  
- Object-Oriented Model: Objects with methods/attributes (e.g., MongoDB for semi-structured data).  
- Entity-Relationship (ER) Model: Visualizes entities and relationships (tools like Lucidchart).  
- Dimensional Model: Optimized for analytics (star/snowflake schemas in data warehouses).  
- NoSQL Models:  
  - Document: JSON-like storage (MongoDB, Couchbase).  
  - Key-Value: Simple pairs (Redis, DynamoDB).  
  - Columnar: Optimized for read-heavy data (Cassandra).  
  - Graph: Nodes + edges (Neo4j, for social networks, fraud detection).  

üîë Use Cases  
- Conceptual: Early-stage brainstorming.  
- Logical: System design blueprints.  
- Physical: Database setup and optimization.
