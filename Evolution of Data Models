ðŸ“Š Evolution of Data Models (1960s) & Key Evaluation Criteria  
The 1960s laid the foundation for modern data management, introducing models that shaped early database systems. Here's an evaluation of key models from this era:

### 1. Hierarchical Model (Mid-1960s)  
- Structure: Tree-like parent-child relationships (single root node).  
  Example: IBMâ€™s IMS (Information Management System).  
- Key Criteria:  
  - Strengths:  
    - Fast for hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts).  
    - Efficient storage with pre-defined paths.  
  - Weaknesses:  
    - Rigid structure (no cross-connections).  
    - Redundancy for non-hierarchical relationships.  
    - Complex updates.  
  - Use Case: Banking transactions, inventory systems.  

### 2. Network Model (Late 1960s)  
- Structure: Graph-like model with multiple parent-child relationships.  
  Example: CODASYL DBTG (Conference on Data Systems Languages â€“ Database Task Group).  
- Key Criteria:  
  - Strengths:  
    - Flexible for complex relationships (e.g., supply chains).  
    - Reduced redundancy vs. hierarchical models.  
  - Weaknesses:  
    - Complexity in design and querying.  
    - Hard to modify after deployment.  
  - Use Case: Airline reservations, telecom networks.  

### 3. Flat File Model  
- Structure: Simple tables with no relationships (plain text or CSV-like files).  
- Key Criteria:  
  - Strengths:  
    - Easy to implement.  
    - Minimal overhead.  
  - Weaknesses:  
    - No querying capabilities.  
    - Data redundancy and inconsistency.  
  - Use Case: Early payroll systems, basic record-keeping.  

### ðŸ”‘ Evaluation Criteria Across Models  
| Criteria          | Hierarchical | Network       | Flat File     |  
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|  
| Flexibility        | Low               | Moderate          | None              |  
| Query Complexity   | High (path-based) | High (manual)     | None              |  
| Scalability        | Limited           | Moderate          | Very Limited      |  
| Data Integrity     | High (rigid)      | Moderate          | Low               |  
| Adoption           | Widespread (IBM)  | Niche (complex)   | Universal         |  

### Why These Models Faded  
- Relational Model (1970s): Introduced by Edgar Codd in 1970, it solved rigidity and complexity with tables, SQL, and flexible relationships.  
- Modern Needs: Scalability, dynamic queries, and user-friendliness made hierarchical/network models obsolete for most use cases.
